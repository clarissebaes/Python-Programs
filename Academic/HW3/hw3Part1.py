fname_stats uses user inputs for name and year to search and index the name in a given year
rank is the index plus 1
count is the number of people named that name in that year
prct_rank1 is the count of the input name compare to the #1 name
total_rank is the count of the input name compared to sum of all counts
same concept for mname
